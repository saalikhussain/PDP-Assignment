# Distributed Training of Random Forest Model for Large Datasets

## 📌 **Objective**
This project aims to address the computational inefficiencies of training Random Forest models on large datasets by leveraging **parallel and distributed computing techniques**. By distributing the workload across multiple nodes, the project demonstrates significant reductions in training time while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

## 🧩 **Project Overview**
Training machine learning models like Random Forests on terabytes of data using sequential methods can be computationally intensive and impractical for time-sensitive applications. This project compares **serial** and **parallel processing** approaches to training Random Forest models on large datasets to evaluate the advantages of distributed systems in terms of speed and scalability.

## 🚀 **Solution**
The solution utilizes **distributed computing frameworks** to train individual decision trees of a Random Forest model in parallel across multiple nodes. By dividing the dataset into manageable chunks and processing them independently, the project achieves:
1. Faster training times.
2. Scalability for handling large datasets.
3. Efficient aggregation of decision trees into a final ensemble model.

## 🔎 **Scope**
- Train Random Forest models on datasets larger than 100 GB.
- Implement distributed data preprocessing and efficient data loading to minimize I/O overhead.
- Compare the performance of **sequential training** and **distributed training** in terms of:
  - Training time.
  - Model accuracy.

## 🛠️ **Tools and Technologies**
The project integrates multiple tools and technologies to achieve distributed training:
- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Dask**: For distributed data processing and Random Forest model training.
- **Pandas/Dask DataFrames**: For data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- **scikit-learn**: To benchmark against sequential Random Forest training implementations.

## 📖 **Methodology**
1. **Data Input**: Load and preprocess large datasets using distributed frameworks.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and split the dataset into manageable chunks.
3. **Distributed Training**:
   - Use frameworks like **Dask** and **Spark** to train individual trees in parallel.
   - Employ bootstrap sampling within each node for ensemble diversity.
4. **Aggregation**: Aggregate trained trees to form the final Random Forest model.
5. **Performance Comparison**:
   - Measure training time and model accuracy for sequential and distributed approaches.

## 🎯 **Expected Outcomes**
- **Efficiency**: Significant reduction in training time (e.g., hours to minutes).
- **Scalability**: Develop a scalable training pipeline for Random Forest models.
- **Performance Validation**: Validate that distributed training maintains or improves accuracy compared to sequential methods.
